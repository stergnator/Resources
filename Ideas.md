“Spacedrive is an open source cross-platform file manager, powered by a virtual 
distributed filesystem (VDFS) written in Rust. UPDATE: Spacedrive is under active 
development, we are in the pre-alpha stage, with builds occasionally released via 
GitHub actions, official alpha coming soon. Organize files across many devices in 
one place. From cloud services to offline hard drives, Spacedrive combines the 
storage capacity and processing power of your devices into one personal distributed 
cloud, that is both secure and intuitive to use. For independent creatives, hoarders 
and those that want to own their digital footprint, Spacedrive provides a free file 
management experience like no other.”
