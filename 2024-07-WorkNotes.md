# Work Journal for August 2024

## Thursday 8/8/2024

- [ ] Read Chapter 13 **Common Modeling Patterns for Time Series** in the book __Modern Time Series Forecasting with Python__
- [ ] Read Blog Post [A Short Chronology Of Deep Learning For Tabular Data](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/deep-learning-for-tabular-data.html)

Wednesday 8/7/2024

- Finished working with Chapter 4 in `DLwP2`.
  - The last section covered text based OHE, which motivated discussion of embeddings.
  - My code can be found [here]((<src/code/python/pt/chap04-E.py>))
- I can now confidently say that the term `Tensor` used in the ML world has
  absolutely nothing to do with mathematical tensors used in physics. Coming
  from a physics/engineering background, the term tensor is used in the
  mathematical sense where the notion of point, vectors, spaces, reference
  systems, and transformations between them are codified. The classical notion
  of tensors (tensor fields) as used in differential geometry, algebraic
  geometry, general relativity, in the analysis of stress and strain in
  materials, and in numerous applications in the physical sciences are not
  what's happening here. In ML they are a multi-dimension matrix - full stop.

- [x] I finished the SolidEdge tutorial named `Part (Ordered Mode)`
  [Introduction to modeling parts with ordered features](https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/246738425/PL20220830878154140.seppabj/seppabj_introduction)
- [SolidEdge Index to Tutorials](https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/246738425/PL20220830878154140.xid1846157/xid486886) is the page that contains a listing and links to the tutorial collection.
- [ ] The next tutorial for me is [`Sheet Metal Part (Hybrid Mode)`](https://docs.sw.siemens.com/en-US/doc/246738425/PL20220830878154140.sessash/xid602585#xid602586)

- [ ] Start Chapter 5 in `DLwP2`

Tuesday 8/6/2024

- Adding new book resource [Modern Time Series Forecasting with Python (2022)](Books/MLB)
  Along with traditional time series techniques, it also covers ML approaches as well as DL approaches.
  - I have cloned the book's github directory
  - [ ] Closely examine the examples of pytorch's dataloader classes.  I should be able to leverage this.
- Additional book resource [Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python (2020)](Books/MLB)
  While this book uses `keras` and `scikit-learn` as opposed to `pytorch` is does have nice explanations.
- [x] Reread 4.3 Representing Tabular Data (Wine Dataset), and worked with the example code  [chap04-B.py](src/code/python/pt/chap04-B.py) closely.
  - Once again, I examined closely their implementation of One Hot Encoding.

---

Monday 8/5/2024

- [ ] Made a [little program](<src/code/python/pt/oneHot.py>) to experiment with One-Hot-Encoding.
  - Made a simple python only version
  - Made a scikit-learn based version
  - Made a pandas based version
  - I think I'm done with One-Hot-Encoding for now!

- Worked on understanding `tensor.scatter_()`.  It's an in place function for moving elements in a tensor according to input sources,

Friday 8/2/2024

- [ ] Make a diversion today and read the `offical` getting started documentation pointed to by the [GitHub PyTorch repo](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)

---

## Thursday 8/1/2024

- [x] Continue reading through Chapter 4 in `DLwP2`
  - Focus on the time series section, 4.4.  Done.  But I don't understand the motivation for re-shaping the tensor.
  - More reading and running the example code was done today.  While I learned more about the PyTorch `tensor`, I am not entirely comfortable with the speed and brevity the book has adopted.  For example, I am still unclear why the airplane travel example, which is a univariate model and a standard example used by most ML tool kits, creates a tensor w/ 3 dimensions for input where two of the dimensions are 1D only, and this does not include the target.  There was mention of this multi-dimensional approach in other models.  There must be some reason motivating it.  Perhaps the GPU really likes this data structure?
  - [ ] Find another resource to help explain the modeling.

## Wednesday 7/31/2024

- [ ] Read Chapter 4 in `DLwP2`
  - I worked through section 4.3.  Each section that I am interested in get's
    its own file.  I check using ipython along the way, and at the end I run the
    whole file.  It's redundant and inefficient, but I learn a little bit more
    that way.  I wish I could just read and absorb, but that's not me.
- [ ] Review Monteprediction
- [ ] Reevaluate the BPNDX system
- I read Chapter 1 `PyTorch Recipes`.  It is an example laden text of the basic
  building blocks for using pytorch notation

## Tuesday 7/30/2024

- [x] Read Chapter 3 in `DLwP2`
  - worked through all examples
    - Aggregated them all in one file `chap03.py` and ran from command line
    - also ran individual examples in ipython
    - wrote my chapter notes into `~/src/code/python/pt/chap03.py`
- Started reviewing resources for time series forecasting using deep learning.
  - stored results in [Resource List](TimeSeriesDeepLearningBooks.md) which is untracked for now.

## Monday 7/29/2024

- Upgraded all python modules on `longboard`

- Installed `PyTorch` using instructions generated via the applet on the
  [PyTorch Start Locally Page.](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)  I
  might as well start locally as I have a [NVidia RTX A4500 /w
  20GB](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a4500/)

```sh
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

### Is it Common to Engineer Features for Deep Learning?

- [ ] [7 of the Most Used Feature Engineering Techniques](https://archive.is/cYtxG)

- [ ] [Feature Engineering For Deep Learning](https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/feature-engineering-for-deep-learning-2b1fc7605ace)

    The conclusion is simple: many deep learning neural networks contain hard-coded data processing, feature extraction, and feature engineering. They may require less of these than other machine learning algorithms, but they still require some.
